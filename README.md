# Hey, Ref!

## Reason for existence

I am refereeing my daughter's soccer games this year, and couldn't find an app that did the two things I wanted, in the ways that I wanted them done. So 'Hey, Ref!' was born.

## It's a React app

No Redux. Just React. It's not very big.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## It lives at hey-ref.netlify.com

So you can go there and use it if you want.
